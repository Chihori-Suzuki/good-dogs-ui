# Good Dogs UI

Your team's overall task is to build a web application that satisfies the following user stories:


1. As a person who is curious about dogs, I want to see a list of dog breed names, so that I can know what are common breed names

1. As a person who is curious about dogs, I want to select a specific dog breed, so that I can find out more information about that breed


The backend team has already completed the REST API's that the front end team will be utilizing. You have been asked to build the initial web interface to satisfy the user stories.

## API Endpoints

A proxy is configured to redirect routes starting with /api to the Good Dogs server (currently [here](https://good-dogs.m90cinjkfob4u.us-west-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com). The following endpoints are available:

GET`/api/dogs`
- Returns the list of dog breeds.

GET `/api/dogs/<name>`
- Returns the details of a specific breed.
- eg. `/api/dogs/Australian%20Shepherd`

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
